class ChirpPacket(Packet):
    """
    Chirp packet of PARRoT

    Attributes:
        src_drone: the source drone that generates this chirp packet
        creation_time: the time when this packet was generated
        id_chirp_packet: to identify the chirp packet uniquely (served as sequence number)
        chirp_packet_length: 40 Byte in [1]
        current_position:
        predicted_position:
        reward: when the node (A) originates the chirp packet, the reward to itself is set to 1.0, when a node further
                forwards the chirp packet, the reward is set to the maximum Q-value to the destination (A). It should be
                noted that each chirp packet is corresponding with a certain destination node
        cohesion: each node regularly calculates the changes in the number of its neighbors, when it initiates or
                  forward a chirp packet, it fills in its latest calculated cohesion
        simulator: the simulation platform that contains everything
